## BEGIN FIRE PRELIMINARY ANALYSES

I will be using the KMA FDRS area for the following preliminary analyses. 

### Combine predictor and response data

The first step I took was to identify days on which multiple fires occurred. I plan to reduce the final dataframe to one entry per calendar day, but will retain a column for the number of fires that occurred on each day. 

```{r multiple-fires}

## Presence-Absence Fire Data

kmaFires <- read.csv("C:/Users/akellner/OneDrive - Colostate/Documents/Fire/KMA_Wx_Fire_Data/KMA_FDRS_Wildfires.csv")

kmaFires$Date <- as.Date(kmaFires$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Find duplicates (multiple fires on a single day)

dups <- kmaFires %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  filter(n() > 1) %>%
  arrange(Date) 

dups <- dups %>%
  add_count(Date) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  rename(count = n)

# remove duplicate rows

dups <- dups %>% # reduce df to only date and count
  select(Date, count) %>%
  distinct()

#dups %>% filter(count == 3)

knitr::kable(dups, caption = "Days in KMA with Multiple Fires")
```

The total number of days between 2015 and 2024 on which multiple fires occurred was 29. 
The maximum number of fires was 3, which occurred once. On all other days, there were two fires. 

n = 29 represents 0.7% of all days

## Create Combined DF for Response Variables

```{r }

# Create df with all dates represented

allDates <- seq(
  from = first(kmaFires$Date),
  to = last(kmaFires$Date),
  by = "day"
)

allDates <- data.frame(Date = allDates) 

allDates <- allDates %>%
  rename(Date = allDates)

# Combine with presence data

kmaFires$Presence <- 1

kmaFires <- kmaFires %>%
  select(Date, Presence)

kmaComplete <- kmaFires %>% # 3659 entries
  full_join(allDates) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>% 
  replace_na(list(Presence = 0)) %>%
  distinct()

kmaComplete <- kmaComplete %>% # 3629 entries
  select(Date, Presence) %>%
  distinct()

kmaAll <- kmaComplete %>%
  left_join(dups)
  
kmaAll <- kmaAll %>%
    mutate(count = coalesce(count, Presence)) %>% glimpse()

glimpse(kmaAll)

knitr::kable(head(kmaAll))

```
